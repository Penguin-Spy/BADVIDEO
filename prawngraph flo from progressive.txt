chunk:
    uint16_t    numOfBytes
    uint8_t     bytes[]


can be split over multiple files




chunkBuffer = buffer containing the current chunk

PRONGRAM FLO:

read next chunk {
    read length of chunk
    if chunk fits into currently open file
        read all of into the buffer
    else
        read what's left into the buffer
        save how much we read
        close file & open next one
        read the rest into the buffer where we left off

    display chunk {
        read frame info from header
        display frame
        if more frames left in chunk, loop
    }

    if more frames left in file, loop
}
