FT260 Pin defaults:
DIO1	GPIOB
DIO2	GPIOE

DIO3	GPIOC (w/ no UART)
DIO4	GPIOD (w/ no UART)

DIO5    GPIO0 (w/ no I²C or EEPROM)
DIO6    GPIO1 (w/ no I²C or EEPROM)

DIO9	GPIOF
DIO10	GPIO4
DIO11	GPIO5

DIO13	GPIOH

To disable UART and use DIO3/4 as GPIO pins, the chip should be configured with
DCNF1	Low
DCNF0	High (Only I²C enabled)
On the UMFT260EV1A, this means JP7-1 connected to JP7-2 (i think), meaning: JP7 VCCIO(power) to DCNF0

To disable I²C and EEPROM and use DIO0/1 as GPIO pins, the board should be configured with
JP3/4/8 as Open, to disconnect the I²C bus pull-up circuit and disable the on-board I²C EEPROM

DIO5/6 can be used as GPIO if I²C is disabled using USB commands (alternate solution if UART is hard to disable)

USB control pipe is used to get/set direction/pin status
i.e. HID SET_REPORT & GET_REPORT
